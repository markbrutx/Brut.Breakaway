# Brut.Breakaway

Personal fork of [Separatism](https://github.com/kirnosenko/BannerlordMods/tree/master/Separatism) mod by kirnosenko.

## Why this fork?

I made this fork for personal use to:
- Fix crashes/bugs when they occur during gameplay
- Have control over the codebase for debugging
- Eventually simplify and clean up the code

This is **not** meant to replace the original mod. If it grows into something distinct with unique features, I may publish it. For now, it's just a working copy.

## Original mod features

- **Lord Rebellions** - Lords with bad relations to their ruler can break away
- **National Rebellions** - Foreign lords of same culture can unite
- **Anarchy Rebellions** - Neglected settlements can rebel
- **Chaos Start** - Option to start with fragmented kingdoms
- MCM settings for fine-tuning

## Requirements

- Bannerlord 1.2.0+
- [MCM (Mod Configuration Menu)](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/612)
